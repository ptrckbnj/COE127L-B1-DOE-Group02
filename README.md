# COE127L-B1-DOE-Group02

### The aim for this project is to implement a conversion of an image to gaussian blur using multi-threading. 

Gaussian blur is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function. It is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. 

The Design of Experiment is about comparing the execution time of using the Gaussian blur on images using multithreading and serial process having bitmap resolution of a picture. Bitmaps are defined as a regular rectangular mesh of cells called pixels, each pixel containing a color value. They are characterized by only two parameters, the number of pixels and the information content (color depth) per pixel. There are other attributes that are applied to bitmaps but they are derivations of these two fundamental parameters.  BMP stands for Bitmap and because they are uncompressed, are larger in size when compared to JPG images. BMPs are typically stored as 32 bits per pixel. 

## Objectives 

To create a Gaussian blur program that uses serial processing on a .bmp image 

To create a Gaussian blur program that uses multithreading on a .bmp image 

To prove that multithreading process is faster than serial process. 

To be able to know the theories for multi-threading and matplotlib python.
